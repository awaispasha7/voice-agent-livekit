# IMPORTANT (Self-hosted telephony):
# LiveKit SIP is a separate service (`livekit/sip`) that listens on 5060/udp + RTP port range.
# Trunks + Dispatch Rules are created via LiveKit API/CLI (`lk sip ...`), NOT via this file.
# Keeping the legacy `sip:` block here can be misleading, so it is intentionally omitted.
