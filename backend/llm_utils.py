EXTRACTION RULES:
1. NUMBERS: Convert words to digits ("zero" → 0, "fifty one" → 51, "twenty five" → 25)
2. YES/NO: Convert to boolean ("yes" → true, "no" → false, "I need it" → true)
3. ZIP CODES: Extract 5-digit codes ("two five nine six three" → "25963")
4. QUANTITIES: Extract numbers from phrases ("around fifteen" → 15, "maybe ten" → 10)
5. TEXT: Clean up responses, remove filler words
6. CONFIDENCE: Rate your confidence in the extraction (0.0-1.0)

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:
- Incomplete responses: "the", "uh can i" → status: "unclear"
- Garbled speech: "some some", "through phone lines" → status: "unclear"
- Ambiguous numbers: "around fifteen" → extract 15 with medium confidence
- Context-dependent answers: "I need it" → true (for yes/no questions)

Return ONLY a JSON object with these keys:

- kind: "number" | "boolean" | "zip" | "text" | "ambiguous"
- value: the extracted value (number, boolean, string)
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 (how certain you are)

EXAMPLES:

{context_info}

USER MESSAGE: "{user_message}"

AVAILABLE INTENTS: {intents_list}

ANALYSIS TASKS:
1. INTENT DETECTION: Does this message indicate a clear intent from the available list?
2. CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING: Is this a response to a question, filler/stuttering, simple greeting, or a new topic?
3. RESPONSE STRATEGY: What should the agent do next?

CRITICAL CONTEXT RULES:
- If user is already in a flow (Flow_1, Flow_2, Flow_3, etc.) and responding to a question, treat as "question_response" with "continue_flow"
- If user mentions menu items (pasta, biryani, qorma, fried rice) while in menu flow, treat as "question_response" with intent_detected="none"
- If user is answering a question about their choice, treat as "question_response" with "continue_flow" and intent_detected="none"
- INTENT DETECTION vs RESPONSE DISTINCTION:
  * "What's in the menu?" → intent_detected="menu" (requesting menu information)
  * "I'll take biryani" → intent_detected="none" (selecting from menu)
  * "Give me pasta" → intent_detected="none" (selecting from menu)
  * "Can I see the menu?" → intent_detected="menu" (requesting menu information)
- Only treat as "new_topic" if user is clearly starting a completely different conversation
- Simple greetings like "Hi", "Hi there", "Hello" should be treated as natural conversation flow, not filtered out. Let the flow continue naturally.

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "intent_detected": "intent_name|none",
    "message_type": "intent_request|question_response|filler|unclear|new_topic|greeting",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "action": "continue_flow|switch_intent|ask_clarification|ignore|respond_naturally",
    "reasoning": "brief explanation of the analysis"
