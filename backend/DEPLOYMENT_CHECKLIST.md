# 🚀 Orchestrator Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **Pre-Deployment Verification**

### **1. Files to Deploy**
- [ ] `backend/conversational_orchestrator.py` (NEW)
- [ ] `backend/llm_utils.py` (UPDATED - includes `make_orchestrator_decision`)
- [ ] `backend/main_dynamic.py` (UPDATED - orchestrator initialization)
- [ ] `backend/ORCHESTRATOR_README.md` (NEW - documentation)
- [ ] `backend/ORCHESTRATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (NEW - summary)
- [ ] `backend/orchestrator_integration_example.py` (NEW - integration guide)

### **2. Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set on your server:
```bash
# Required for orchestrator
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here  # ✅ Should already be set

# Required for FAQ bot integration
ALIVE5_BASE_URL=https://api-v2-stage.alive5.com  # ✅ Should already be set
FAQ_BOT_ID=your-faq-bot-id  # ✅ Should already be set
```

### **3. Dependencies**
All dependencies are already in your environment:
- [x] `openai` - For GPT-4 calls
- [x] `fastapi` - Backend framework
- [x] `pydantic` - Data validation
- [x] `httpx` - HTTP client

No new dependencies needed! 🎉

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Upload Files**
```powershell
# Using your existing deployment script
./deploy-simple.ps1

# OR manually:
scp backend/conversational_orchestrator.py user@server:/path/to/backend/
scp backend/llm_utils.py user@server:/path/to/backend/
scp backend/main_dynamic.py user@server:/path/to/backend/
```

### **Step 2: Restart Backend Service**
```bash
# On your server
sudo systemctl restart alive5-backend

# Check status
sudo systemctl status alive5-backend

# Watch logs
./logs-backend
```

### **Step 3: Verify Initialization**
Look for these log messages:
```
✅ CUSTOM TEMPLATE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY
🔧 LOADED BOTCHAIN: voice-1
🔧 LOADED ORG: alive5stage0
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Initialized successfully with template  # <-- NEW!
```

If you see the orchestrator initialization message, you're good to go! 🎉

---

## 🧪 **Testing After Deployment**

### **Test 1: Basic Functionality**
```
# Start a conversation
User: "Hello"
Expected: Greeting response

# Check logs for:
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Analyzing message for intelligent routing...
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Decision → handle_conversationally
```

### **Test 2: FAQ Routing**
```
User: "What does Alive5 do?"
Expected: FAQ bot response about Alive5

# Check logs for:
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Decision → use_faq
🔀 ORCHESTRATOR: Routing to FAQ bot
```

### **Test 3: Flow Execution**
```
User: "I want marketing information"
Expected: Start marketing flow

# Check logs for:
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Decision → execute_flow
🔀 ORCHESTRATOR: Starting flow → marketing
```

### **Test 4: Refusal Handling**
```
Agent: "What's your name?"
User: "I don't want to say"
Expected: Acknowledge and continue

# Check logs for:
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Decision → handle_refusal
🔒 ORCHESTRATOR: Marked field 'name' as refused
```

## 🎯 **Current Status: FOUNDATION READY**

### **✅ What's Working**
- Orchestrator initialization on template load
- User profile creation and management
- LLM decision-making engine ready
- Error handling and fallbacks in place
- Comprehensive logging

### **⏳ What's Next (Optional Integration)**
The orchestrator is **ready but not yet actively routing**. To fully activate it:

1. **Integrate into `process_flow_message()`**
   - Call `orchestrator.process_message()` early in the function
   - Route based on `decision.action`
   - Update profiles as conversation progresses

2. **Add Field Checking**
   - Use `orchestrator.should_skip_field()` before asking questions
   - Use `orchestrator.get_collected_value()` to avoid re-asking

3. **Fine-Tune Prompts**
   - Adjust LLM prompts based on real conversation patterns
   - Add domain-specific examples
   - Tune confidence thresholds

**You can deploy now and integrate gradually!** 🎯

---

## 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
```python
# In your logs, look for:

# Decision quality
"🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Confidence → X.XX"

# Profile usage
"👤 ORCHESTRATOR: Profile → {collected_info, objectives}"

# Refusal handling
"🔒 ORCHESTRATOR: Marked field 'X' as refused"

# Decision distribution
USE_FAQ: X% | EXECUTE_FLOW: Y% | HANDLE_CONVERSATIONALLY: Z%
```

### **Dashboard Ideas** (Future)
- Decision type distribution
- Average confidence scores
- User profile richness
- Refusal rate by field
- FAQ vs Flow vs Conversational split

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Orchestrator not initializing**
**Symptoms:**
```
✅ CUSTOM TEMPLATE LOADED SUCCESSFULLY
🔧 LOADED BOTCHAIN: voice-1
# Missing: 🧠 ORCHESTRATOR: Initialized successfully
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check logs for error
./logs-backend | grep "ORCHESTRATOR"

# Common causes:
# 1. Import error - verify conversational_orchestrator.py uploaded
# 2. Template format issue - check bot_template structure
```

### **Issue: LLM timeout or errors**
**Symptoms:**
```
🧠 ORCHESTRATOR LLM: Error: ...
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# 2. Test API connectivity
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# 3. Check rate limits on OpenAI dashboard
```

### **Issue: Decision quality low**
**Symptoms:**
- Orchestrator makes wrong routing decisions
- Low confidence scores (< 0.6)

**Solution:**
```python
# In llm_utils.py, adjust system prompt:
# - Add more domain-specific examples
# - Clarify decision criteria
# - Adjust temperature (currently 0.3)
```

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

You'll know the orchestrator is working when:

- [x] Backend starts without errors
- [x] Orchestrator initialization log appears
- [ ] FAQ questions route to Bedrock (Test)
- [ ] Flow requests start appropriate flows (Test)
- [ ] Refusals are handled gracefully (Test)
- [ ] User profiles persist across messages (Test)
- [ ] Decision reasoning makes sense (Review logs)

## 📞 **Support & Next Steps**

### **If you see any issues:**
1. Check logs: `./logs-backend`
2. Review error messages
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test OpenAI API connectivity

### **Ready for full integration?**
Follow the patterns in:
- `orchestrator_integration_example.py` - Copy-paste integration code
